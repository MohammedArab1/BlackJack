# BlackJack
BlackJack game I made while learning python, proud of this because it showcases my progress with python. I did it mostly on my own but had to use some tutorials here and there, took me approximately two days. Made this on August 28th-29th 2021. 

Simple guide to play (must have python installed): 
1. Clone github project using following command: git clone https://github.com/MohammedArab1/BlackJack
2. cd into cloned directory using command line
3. run the following command: python BlackJack.py
